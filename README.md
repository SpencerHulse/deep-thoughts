# deep-thoughts

## Description

This is a React social media site, which allows users to log in, post thoughts, react to thoughts, and add friends. It uses React Router to provide a more user-friendly experience. It also uses Apollo Server to provide back-end functionality. The entire site is designed to be responsive and dynamic, depending on whether the user is logged in.

A live version of the app can be found on [Heroku](https://sleepy-ridge-57702.herokuapp.com/).
